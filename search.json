    "text": "Revision for 2022-2023:\n\n\nCheck out Jens’ project. As of March 2022, need to open it in the current dev version.\n\n\n\n\nPamela, I’m leaning toward dropping the play ♪ block from the XML files. Not only is it easily confused with the play ♪ pitch: () beats: () block (which I’ve been calling play ♪ in the text), but also, it obscures understanding of what’s going with the processing of the table, which I’m explaining in the yellow box below. What do you think of this plan? –MF, 2/24/22\n\n\nIn this activity, you’ll teach the computer to play some simple songs and move those songs up and down the musical scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA command block tells the computer to do something without reporting a value.\n\n\n\nAll these js-run things should be changed to plain old snap projects, because right now sbe/versions/v7 is the same as sbe/versions/dev, which is a not-for-users experiment right now. This is arguably a bug in the Snap! site, and I’ll work on getting it fixed, but since v7 is now regular Snap!, there’s no need to call it out specially. –bh 3/3/22\n\nI think this is a comment for Michael. –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\nOpen this Song Player project, and save it to your account. It includes a  command block that takes two inputs: a note to play (pitch) and how long to play it (beats).\n\n\n\n“click the triangle”: is it a policy to call it that, rather than a down-arrowhead? It took me a moment to figure out what triangle you meant. –bh 3/3/22\n\nThat’s what we’ve been doing in CSP. I took Pamela’s suggestion and included the Unicode. –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\nThe pitch tells the computer which note to play. It can be any whole number from 0 to 127. The number 60 represents the note known as middle C. If you click the triangle (▼), a piano menu will open, and you can hear the note you are selecting. \n\n\nThe number of beats tells the computer how long to play the note. By default, Snap! plays 60 beats per minute (bpm), so playing a note for 1 beat takes 1 second. You can change the number of beats per minute by using .\n\n\n\n\nI find both of these inputs problematic. The first one is called “pitch” because you want “note” to mean something else. Avoiding “note” is fine, but “pitch” implies frequency, in Hz, not MIDI note number. I would suggest “note#” or I guess you could get away with “pitch#” or even “pianokey#” or “MIDI#”. But “note#” is closest to what the rest of the world calls it.\n\n\nAs for the second input, when I learned about this stuff a million years ago, a “beat” meant one of whatever the denominator of the time in the key signature is, e.g., in 4/4 time it’s a quarter note. You’re using “beat” to mean a whole measure. The default of 60 bpm is something we inherited from Scratch, and they did it that way because at first they didn’t have a REST block in Sound, so they used WAIT () SECS for rests, so they wanted the unit of time to be seconds for music too. More typically, you see bpm=120 or 180 at the top of a score; it’s the number you tell your metronome, for how often it should tick. 120bpm means that a quarter note is 1/2 second, and a measure takes two seconds. That’s a fairly slow meter. 180bpm means a quarter note is 1/3 second, so a measure is 1.333 seconds, which is more lively. I suggest that the project should set tempo to 180.\n\n\nI can see that it makes a certain amount of sense to have an input value of 1/4 for a quarter note, but then “beats” is the wrong name. The really right thing, since you’re using a custom block anyway, is to have that input be a pulldown menu from which you can select quarter note, half note, etc., both spelled out and with the Unicode music symbol. And the label could be “note type” or “length” or “duration.” I know changing this means lots of changes throughout the lab, probably, but any kid who does know something about music, which is a lot of kids, will find this nomenclature strange. –bh 3/3/22\n\ni know nothing about music so I defer to brian’s expertise. –pf 3/3\n\nThanks Brian. I’m leaving this for us to discuss next year as it’s a bit too late to change the whole lab now. I hear you on what’s wrong here, but I disagree with the dropdown as I find it limiting. Looking forward to discussing further when we come back around to this lab. After reading your paragraph, I’m leaning toward play ♪ number: () length: (). Or even just play note, number: () length: (). –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\nChange the inputs to the play ♪ block and then click it, and then change the inputs and click it again to see how the note changes.\n\n\nTip: Right click a block and select “help” to see an explanation of how to use it.\n\n\nAttach several play ♪ blocks together one after another to begin creating a song.\n\n\nYou can use  to create breaks in your song.\n\n\nYou can use  block to repeat any command (or group of commands) a specific number of times. Any code you put inside the C-shape of the repeat block will be repeated.\n\n\nDid an earlier lab already give repeat a thorough introduction? I was surprised to see it so casually introduced, since looping is usually A Big Deal when I teach it in text-based coding classes. It’s certainly easier in block-based, but I feel like it warrants its own section, so that you can talk about what goes in the loop vs. out of the loop (i.e. set-instrument can just be outside the loop, no need to repeat it twice). -PF 2/10/22\n\nThis is here on the principle of “experience before formality.” The idea is that they have the opportunity (not required) to play with it and try to see what it does before it is formally thought. I thought that might work well with REPEAT since it does exactly what is says. ;) I added a little extra text to help. We can ask teacher for feedback about it… (Mary TODO) Does that seem sensible? What do you think, Brian? –MF, 2/10/22\n\n\nI think the informal introduction is fine, and I don’t think looping has to be such a big deal, but I really don’t like “Anything above it will happen before; anything below will happen after” because it makes it sound as if the REPEAT block somehow affects the sequencing of what comes before and after it. I would just not say it, but if you think something has to be said, it should be more like “the entire REPEAT loop counts as one step in the larger script of which it’s a part” or something like that, to make it clear that the overall sequence of steps isn’t messed up by the loop. -bh 3/3/22\n\n\nHm, my point about not repeating set-instrument inside REPEAT is probably too subtle for an “experience before formality” type introduction to repeat. Maybe something to point out in the teachers guide, like “if you notice a student has nested blocks inside the repeat that don’t need to be repeated, you could suggest moving them out” with a screenshot of the set-instrument example. And then you can delete the “Any code….” line here since bh doesn’t like it and I also don’t think it adds much. -pf 3/3\n\n\nBrian, I took that out for now, but this is their first experience with sequencing, and I was trying to explain a bit about how it works. Pamela, I’m not convinced that the TG remark you suggested is needed because this is just a chance for them to play around. I’d rather the teacher not critique a fine point like that. I deleted the line Brian suggested; aren’t you asking for the “Any code you put inside the C-shape…” to be removed also? –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\nYou can also use  to change the instrument,  to change the tempo (beats per minute), or  to change the volume. Wherever you put one of these blocks, the sound will change from that point on.\n\n\n\nHere are two examples:\n\n\n\n\nIn little-lamb, the two notes just before the REST blur into one for me. Other instances of consecutive notes at the same pitch don’t do that. This sounds like a deficiency in Snap! music handling, but do you understand why? Also, I think that huge long rest sounds wrong; I would leave it out. -bh 3/3/22\n\n\nset-instrument-3 is a horrifying sound to me (sawtooth). really grating. I find 2 and 4 more soothing. -pf 3/3\n\n\nIf you wanted an example song that didn’t feel like a lil kids song but that everyone knows, you could do Happy Birthday to You -pf 3/3\n\n\nI made no changes here because these are matters of taste, and I need to move on to the next lab. –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\nMary Had a Little Lamb\n\n\nSuper Mario Theme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity, you connected several command blocks together to create a song."

    "text": "In this activity, you’ll learn about the difference between programming by nesting reporter blocks inside each other and programming by stacking command blocks top to bottom.\n\n\nCommands Versus Reporters\n\n\nBefore this unit, you nested blocks inside each other so that the output reported by one block became the input to another. That style of programming is known as functional programming, and in Snap!, it uses reporter blocks. A reporter computes a value and reports it (to you or to other blocks). \n\n\nIn this unit, you’ve been stacking blocks that carry out actions, such as playing a note. This style of programming is called imperative programming. In Snap!, imperative programming uses command blocks. A command tells the computer to do something, (play a sound, draw, move, change something, etc.). Commands have effects. \n\n\nThe shapes of the blocks go with the shapes of the places where you can use them. Reporters are round, and they go into round slots in a block. Commands are more rectangular, and they have a tab at the bottom that fits into the gap at the top of another command block. Snap! won’t let you put a reporter in a stack of commands or put a command in a round slot.\n\n\n\nYou learned about reporters in Lab 2 Page 4: Making Your Own Block.\n\n\nA reporter block does a calculation and reports the result. Reporters have an oval shape.    \n\n\nA predicate is a special kind of reporter that asks a true/false question and reports either true or false. Predicates have a hexagon shape.   \n\n\nA command block tells the computer to do something without reporting a value. Commands have a puzzle shape and can be snapped together one after another.    \n\n\nUnlike reporters, a command block doesn’t report anything, so you can’t use its result as the input to another block—its result is an action, not a value!\n\n\n\nCreating a Command Block\n\n\nYou’ve created a reporter block before. You can create a command block in almost exactly the same way.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your project isn’t open already, log in to Snap!, and open your “Song Player” project.\n\n\nCreate a new command block called mystery song.\n\n\nRight-click in an empty spot in the Scripts area and choose “make a block…”  \n\n\nChoose the palette for your block: Sound.\n\n\nType the title (name) for your block: mystery song.\n\n\nSelect the shape for your block: Command.\n\n\nClick “OK.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create a reporter, the block editor opens with  attached to the hat block, and whatever input you give to report will be the value reported by the new reporter. When you create a command, the block editor opens with only the hat block, and the blocks attached below it will run (one at a time) when the new command is run.\n\n\n\n\n: Abstraction\n\nHiding away the details of how code works (such as by moving it inside a new block) is a form of abstraction.\n\n\n\nInside the mystery song block, either build a new song for someone else to guess or drag in a song you have already created and attach it to the mystery song hat block.\n\n\nNote to Mary for later: An animation of dragging in a song would be nice here. –MF, 2/9/22\n\n\nPlay your mystery song for someone else, and see if they can guess what it is. Then guess someone else’s song.\n\nYou can find your newly created block at the end of the Sound blocks in the sidebar, and drag it out to the scripting area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate additional command blocks with different mystery songs.\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity, you created a command block to store a sequence of commands."

If these blocks are not in your project, go back to the first activity, press and hold the shift key while you reload the page, open the project in exercise #2, choose “Save As…” from the Snap! File menu, and save with a new name (so you don’t lose your prior work).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use ask and wait to ask the user a question (and store their response), and you can use  to tell the user something that isn’t a question.\n\n\nClick for another hint.\n\n\n\nThe script for your game needs to do three things:\n\n\nPlay your mystery song\n\n\nAsk the user to guess the song\n\n\nTell the player whether the guess is correct\n\n\n\n\nClick for a third hint.\n\n\n\nUse the if else command block to test whether the guess is correct with a predicate like .

I believe some of this was here at Dan’s request, so I’m not cutting without more attention. –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\n\nI’m not sure what you expect them to do here. If the idea is that they nest another IF ELSE in the else clause of the first one, that’s a whole new idea, and one students find hard, not appropriate for an ITIT. I’m not sure this is salvageable, but it might be with a serious rewriting. –bh 3/3/22\n\n\nI assumed it was just using an or. Maybe should explicitly suggest using the or block. You can also say “to allow the user to be correct with different variations on the song title”, which is different from having to implement a spell checker (a quite difficult task, as 61A students will attest this semester!). -pf 3/3/22\n\n\nI made this a TIF for now. (And then I cut it.) ;) –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\n\nUse a second if else block and predicate (hexagonal testing function) to allow the user to be correct even with a different variation of the spelling of the song. For example, you might want the game to approve either “The Alphabet Song” or “Alphabet.”\n\n\nIf you created two mystery songs, you could make a new command block that randomly chooses which one to play by using random together with if else.\n\n\n\nI like this idea, but I don’t see a way to do more than two mystery songs with the blocks they know at this point (e.g., not global or script variables—globals are taught later in this lab). Am I missing anything? –MF, 2/10/22\n\n\nI don’t understand the question. How can they do even two songs? Presumably by putting the two song scripts in the slots of the IF ELSE. Well, if they can do that, they can nest two IF ELSE blocks, as in the ITIT above, and that gives them three slots for songs, etc. –bh 3/3/22\n\n\nI also don’t know how to do this without using some variable to track which song they ended up picking and asking about, since we need that to happen before the if/else that checks the answer. Ah okay well I guess you can have the if condition be a random number between 1 and length of songs, and then inside the if/else clause, it plays the song and asks them for their guess, but then I bet they’ll end up repeating all that ask-code and it’ll be gross. I feel like doing this cleanly is hard. –pf 3/3/22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity, you used the command if else to control what the game says to the player."

Thoughts? “Listing the Notes of a Song”? “Simplifying Your Song”? “Programming a Song More Efficiently” “Playing Each Note in a List”? I like “Playing Each Note in a List” best. Thoughts? –MF, 2/12/22 +1 bh\n\nTo do for next year. –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\nI made a really nice FOR EACH animation that is buried in a yellow box on page 8. I should make another one for this page. It should probably go just before the second header (after exercise 3). –MF, 2/27/22\n\n\nIn this activity, you will make it easier to play a song by putting the notes in a list.\n\n\nUsing For Each to Traverse a List\n\n\n\nThe paragraph below is well-intentioned, but it doesn’t belong here. Maybe after your sample song that uses REPEAT?\n\n\nWhere do you mean, exactly? –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\nUsing the repeat block strategically can make your code shorter and easier to read. It’s generally a good idea to write shorter code that is easier to read because when something isn’t working right, it’s easier to find and fix the problem, or when you want to change it later or have someone else read it, that’s easier too.\n\n\n\n\n One way to simplify writing a song is to use a list to store the pitches and then play each pitch in the list. You can use for each to run a command (or group of commands) for each item in a list. For example:  \n\n\nPlaying the pitch 0 works like a rest (a pause in the music).\n\n\n\nA list is an ordered sequence of items. You’ve been using lists throughout this course: to store words for a story, to manipulate the letters of a secret message, and even to store lists such as each individual’s responses to the question in a survey.\n\n\nWhat does “ordered” mean?\n\n\nIt doesn’t mean that the items have to appear in alphabetical or numeric order. It just means that these are different lists:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in to Snap!, and do one of the following:\n\n\nThis might be a risky move. I was hoping to give the kids a chance to start from scratch if they had a cluttered project, but it does mean that from this page on, some students will have only one project for the lab while others will have two. It also means that I can’t refer to their project by name on the subsequent pages, so if they name it awkwardly and forget the name, they won’t be able to find it. Thoughts? –MF, 2/23/22\n\n\nThe further along I get in writing this lab, the more I regret this choice because I have no way of telling them what project I want them to open other than “your last one”. I’m now thinking they should start from a new starter XML here without any option. Thoughts? –MF, 2/27/22\n\n\nI agree, pick one. I first thought they should start with the example project, but then they don’t get the practice in exercise 2. Maybe have them start with the sample (which should be called the starter instead of sample) but still make them make their own FOR EACH block? -bh 3/3/22\n\n\nHow about they start with starter project and you can remind them they can open up song player in another tab to remember the pitches that they used? -pf 3/3/22\n\n\nTo resolve next time around. –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\n\nOpen the for each example project and save it to your Snap! account.\n\n\nOpen your “Song Player” project if isn’t open already.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a simple song using for each.

Let’s address this at a meeting. –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag the pitch variable into the “pitch” input (the first input) of the play ♪ block. Dragging will make a copy of pitch, so you should see pitch in both places. \n\n\nType a number for the “beats” input (the second input) of the play ♪ block. (For example, if you want half notes, type the number “0.5”.)\n\n\nDrag a list block into the list input slot of the for each block, add some notes, and click the script to test out your song as you build it. \n\n\nTips for working with the list block:\n\n\nIf you hold down the “shift” key when you press the ◂ or ▸ buttons, it will remove or add three spaces at the end of the list instead of just one.\n\n\nYou can press the “tab” key to move the typing cursor to the next input slot without using your mouse.\n\n\nIf you want to add or remove a pitch from your list, you don’t have to move the other numbers around. To add a new slot, right-click the slot where you want it to appear, and select “insert a slot.” To remove a slot, right-click it, and select “delete slot.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure your script plays your song correctly before moving on.\n\n\n\n\nMaybe add a page break here in the future? –MF, 2/28/22\n\n\nUsing For Each to Play Any List of Pitches\n\n\nYou can create a play song block that will apply this script to any input song. \n\n\n\n\nHow much experience have they had before this of generalizing a script by turning it into a procedure with an input? They should have done that several times by now, no? So that experience should be called out here. “Remember how you generalized your blah blah by making it a procedure with an input? You can do the same thing with this script that plays the notes in a list.” –bh 3/3/22\n\n\nTo revisit… –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new command block called play song that takes a list of notes as input and plays each note in the list using for each.\n\nIf we ever remake this animation, the play song block should be pink! –MF, 2/21/22\n\n\n\nClick for a hint.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new block called play song that takes one input called song, which will be a list of pitches.

The help text should describe what the block takes as input and what effect the block produces.\n\nAn example: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes my play song block have to play every note for the same length of time?\n\n\n\nNo. On a later page, you can learn a way to store and play songs with both pitch and beat information about each note.\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity, you used for each to play each pitch in a list and created a play song block that will work with any list of pitches.\n\n\n\nThis is a more general problem, but it looks particularly bad here: When a &lt;code&gt; text embedded in a line includes spaces, the spaces are way too big compared to all the other spaces on the line. Ideally you’d say &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; but that’s too horrible to contemplate, so somehow it should be fixed in the Javascript. –bh 3/3/22\n\n\nGo for it! :) –MF, 3/6/22"

The  and  blocks each take a note (♪) as input and report only one piece of information to the play ♪ block.  \n\n\nSo, play song with pitches and beats takes a table of song data with pitches and beats as input (song), and it plays each note (♪) at the specified pitch for the specified number of beats. \n\n\n\n\n\nMARY TODO: I need to do add this block to the previous XML projects and give it help text.

And both the map MHALL and map TWINKLE don’t either and also they might need help text on the play song block.

Also, another Snap music bug- it seems like the final note sometimes persists for way longer, perhaps related to me being in a separate tab. -PF 3/3/22\n\n\nYes, that’s by design. ;) There is a change tempo block inside the repeat.

You can also transpose the pitch values stored in a table.\n\nNeeds alt-title text. –MF, 2/27/22\n\n\n\n\n This code is a bit complicated. Notice that it plays a version of Mario Theme that has gone through the map block. So the question is: What does this map block do?\n\n\n\nObviously, this whole page a bit of a reach, but I feel like the question will arise for some kids of how to do this, and so I want to offer something for them (even if they just read it on their own time). In the TG, this will be listed as optional. Any suggestions for improving this presentation? –MF, 2/27/22\n\n\nYeah, this is a bit of a doozy, especially because they really should have read the yellow box on the previous page to understand the ADT selectors. I definitely think it should be optional, as you say it is. Maybe you can make sure they’ve read that yellow box, or repeat all/parts of it here? -pf 3/6/22\n\n\nI’ve added a first problem on this page about going back and reading that. Sufficient to close this comment, or should we discuss this further? –MF, 3/7/22\n\n\n\nRecall that play song with pitches and beats expects a table of song data as input, map works through every item in a list, and every item in the table of pitches and beats is one note. So, map applies a function to every note in the Mario Theme and outputs a table of notes (pairs of pitches and beats).  → \n\n\nIn order for map to output a table of pitches and beats, it needs to apply a function that outputs pairs of pitches and beats. So the code needs a structure like this: \n\n\nWhat function outputs pitches and beats? The  block. So the code needs a structure like this:\n\nNeeds alt-title text. –MF, 2/27/22\n\n\n\n\nBut remember that the inputs that end up in the blank spots of the function in the map block each time it applies the function are the items in the input list, which in this case are the notes (pitches and beats from Mario Theme (with beats)).\n\n\nSo, to get a beats value in the beats slot, we need to use the beats from ♪ block, which takes a note (with a pitch and a beat) and reports just the beat.\n\nNeeds alt-title text. –MF, 2/27/22\n\n\n\n\nAnd to get a pitch value in the pitch slot, we need to use the pitches from ♪ block, and we need to add our shift value to do the transpose.\n\nNeeds alt-title text. (copy from above once written) –MF, 2/27/22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back to the previous activity page, open all the links in the box labeled “How does the play song with pitches and beats block work?”, and read all the information included there. Before moving on, discuss any questions you have about how that block works.\n\n\n Read through the description above again, and discuss how mapping over a table takes a song (with pitch and beat data) as input and reports a song with the pitches transposed (shifted). Explain it in your own words.\n\n\nOpen your “Song Player - Pitches and Beats” Snap! project.\n\n\nUse the structure of the code shown above as a guide, and transpose one of your songs.\n\n\n\nThey don’t need a hint. All they’re asked to do is copy your code but with a different song substituted. For them to understand the code may be hard, but the hint doesn’t help with that, and it’s not required of them. Having a hint will just make them worry that they’re missing something. –bh 3/3/22\n\n\nI included this here so they don’t have to scroll around to find it. If the are looking for a hint, it’s because scrolling up didn’t work somehow. Feel free to suggest a tweak, but that’s the idea behind having it. –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\n\nNeed a hint?\n\n\n\nYour code should look like this but with your own song variable in place of Mario Theme (with beats) and a different shift value (instead of 5).\n\nNeeds alt-title text.

What about other shifts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, cut for now, but left for possible discussion. I don’t disagree with any of this; I was trying to get at “Why is this so complicated? Can we do this an easier way?” and empower students: “If you have an idea, try it!” But I guess it’s not as empowering to say “try it” i this case… –MF, 3/6/22\n\n\nI don’t understand why this problem is here in particular. It’s something that could be asked all of the zillion places in which this curriculum shows how to do something. Do you have in mind a particular thing you think they’ll try that won’t work? –bh 3/3/22\n\n\nDo you have an idea for a different way to transpose a song that has both pitch and beat information? Try to build it. If it works, explain how it works to someone else. If it doesn’t work, talk with someone else and figure out why it doesn’t work.\n\n\nI’m noticing a bunch of these exhortations in yellow boxes in the curriculum. I’m not a fan. This particular one is especially bad because it tells students, “you think you know another way, but it’s not going to work, ha ha, you’re dumb.” I would go through the whole curriculum, find all of these, and remove them. –bh 3/3/22\n\nUnderstanding why code you thought would work doesn’t actually work is an important part of programming.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity, you shifted the pitches and left the beats alone, but you could use map to change the beats in some way. Try it!\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity, you learned how to use map in a more complicated situation in which you want to transform only part of an item with multiple parts."

The algorithm doesn’t have to be written in any particular programming language or even in a programming language at all; you can write your algorithm in English or any other human language. Some people call an algorithm written in human language pseudocode. Once you know the steps that the computer will take, you can code your algorithm in the programming language of your choice.\n\n\nWhat’s the purpose of “pseudocode”? Why write an algorithm vaguely in English when you could write it precisely in Snap!? If you were programming in a punctuation-heavy language, designing your program in pseudocode would help you focus on the important ideas instead of on details like quotation marks and semicolons. But pseudocode isn’t as necessary with a language like Snap!, and pseudocode can make it easy for you to fall into wishful thinking about what the computer is capable of (such as writing “Pick tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers” or “Here’s the melody; write the harmony”).\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.A, AAP-3.A part b\n\n\n\n  Describe what this algorithm will make the sprite do: \n\n\nLog in to Snap! and build that script to test your hypothesis.\n\n\nClick it, and watch what the sprite does.\n\n\nClick , and then click your script to run it again.\n\n\n\n\nYou can click pen down (or any block) in the palette on the left or in the scripting area to run it. If you click a block inside a script, the whole script runs.\n\n\n Analyze why that script does what it does.\n\n\nCompare your work with another pair. If your script behaves differently from theirs, check both.\n\n\n\nUsing Visible Stepping\n\n\nSnap! has a tool called Visible Stepping that allows you to control how quickly Snap! steps through the blocks of your code.\n\n\n\nClick the Visible Stepping button (), and adjust the slider to control the stepping speed. When you run your code, the sprite will slowly execute each step of the code and highlight it in cyan.\n\nClick for a video of adjusting the Visible Stepping slider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can slow the stepping to do only one step at a time and wait until you tell Snap! to go on to the next one. Move the slider all the way to the left, and then you can press the Run/Pause button () to see what happens at each step of your code.\n\nClick for a video of single-stepping through code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisible stepping can be useful as you read someone else’s code because you can watch it at human speed instead of computer speed. It’s also useful in debugging (fixing problems with) your own code when it’s doing something wrong.\n\n\n\n Switch who is sitting at the keyboard. Then experiment:\n\n\nYou can put your sprite back in the center of the screen with  and you can reset the direction it’s pointing with .\n\n\nChange 100 to 50 in the move block of your script by clicking on the 100 and typing 50. Then click the script again to run it with the new input value.\n\n\nClick the  block in the green Pen palette.\n\n\nChange the number in the turn block and run the script again… and again… and again.\n\n\nClear the stage again, and change the number in the  block.\n\n\nExperiment with the input numbers in the turn and repeat blocks. Try to draw a triangle with equal sides.\n\n\nUse  to set the pen size to something like 4 or 10 or 50. Then click your repeat, move, turn script again.\n\n\nTo change the pen size you must click the set pen size block to run it after you’ve entered the number you want.\n\n\nUse  to experiment with the pen color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment: What leaves a trace?\n\n\nMove the sprite by dragging it to a new location. Does it leave a trace as you move it?\n\n\nMove the sprite by clicking on . Does it leave a trace as it moves?\n\n\nDoes clicking  leave a trace?\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure your other work has been saved, then  Experiment with the scripts and look inside them to figure out how they work. Could you change the sizes or colors to make it more interesting?\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\nSolid rectangles. Make and run this script:  The light blue set block is in the Sensing palette, where it looks like . Just click once in the hexagonal slot to get True (the green check box). If you’re not sure what difference the “flat line ends” makes, try clicking the hexagonal slot again to run the script with that option False. And of course you can change all the numbers, or have your program pick random numbers.\n\n\nColor families. Click the file menu icon and select “Libraries…” Then, find the “Colors and Crayons” library and click “Import.”   In the Pen menu you’ll find the set pen to crayon block. Computers can display billions of colors, but unless you have to match the paint on your wall very precisely, finding your way through all those colors may be more trouble than it’s worth. The crayon library, just like a box of crayons, gives you a small set of vibrant colors, arranged in families. So if you want a lot of browns in your picture, you could pick a random number between 30 and 39. \n\n\n\nAt the right is a painting by Kazimir Malevich. Its elements are rectangles, either horizontal or at a 45-degree angle, plus or minus a few degrees. You can position rectangles randomly. Your picture doesn’t have to look like his—you’re the artist!\n\n\nAlphie: If we just put rectangles in randomly, the tiny square dots will often be covered by larger ones. Maybe we should do big ones first and smaller ones later.\n\n\nGamal: I know ours don’t have to look like the original, but I really like that huge black horizontal rectangle. It gives the painting a structure, with a top part and a bottom part, even though it doesn’t go all the way across. I want to make sure to have one like that.\n\n\nBetsy: I bet we can use the idea of drawing really thick lines without using flat line ends and get interesting results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the right is a painting by Theo van Doesburg. It has some things in common with the Malevich picture, mainly the use of rectangles as the design elements. But there are no 45-degree rectangles; instead, the constraint is that rectangles may not overlap, so if you want to place a random rectangle in the picture, each end may have to be shortened to avoid collisions. You can use  to find out if the point behind the sprite’s rotation center is black."

You can use the clean up option by right-clicking (or control-clicking on a Mac) in the scripting area to organize your blocks. You can remove a block or script either by dragging it out of the scripting area and back to the palettes on the left or by choosing the “delete” option from the drop-down menu. Click here for a video. (Note that this is different from the “delete block definition” option which will permanently delete a custom block and all its instances from your entire project.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy up the code in your project, if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind inputs to pinwheel that make the result look like a circle.\n\n\n\n\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\nOn the right is a painting by Vassily Kandinsky. The four pictures above were inspired by it, but the sizes and placement of the circles in the original were carefully chosen, whereas the ones above are random. Also, Kandinsky’s solid circles aren’t quite uniform in color. For example, the green circle near the top right of the picture has a light green outer border, a somewhat darker green inside, a blue-green inner border, and black inside that.\n\nWhen two solid circles overlap, you can see both colors, or rather, a color in between the two. To achieve that effect in Snap!, before drawing the second circle, use the  block. A transparency of 0 means you see only the new color; a transparency of 100 means you see only the old color. In-between values determine which color is stronger in the overlapping area.\n\nMost of Kandinsky’s circles are solid, but a few aren’t. most notably the large white “halo” near the middle of the painting. His hollow circles don’t have a constant width; if you want yours to look like his, change the pen size a little as you’re drawing. But of course you don’t have to make your art look exactly like his, nor exactly like the examples above. Use them for inspiration, but you’re the artist.\n\n\nMake a picture that looks more like a real pinwheel:\n Copyright 2010 Victoria Hudgins. Used by permission.\n\n(Save your project first; you’ll need the pinwheel block you already have later.)\n\n\nIt doesn’t have to look exactly like the photo.

    "text": "On this page, you will use your existing pinwheel block to make asterisk and polygon blocks. \n\n\nYou can use your general-purpose pinwheel procedure to create other, simpler special-purpose procedures that each do a particular job.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it isn’t open already, open your U1L3-Pinwheel project from the previous page.\n\n\nUse your pinwheel block to create a more specialized asterisk block.\n\n\nFirst, make a new block called asterisk with two inputs: one for the number of branches and one for the length of each branch. You may wish to review how to make a new block at Lab 2 Page 6: Making Your Own Block.\n\n\n\nNow fill in the three inputs to pinwheel so that it correctly draws an asterisk.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, write a polygon block that uses pinwheel with appropriate inputs to draw a polygon with a given number of sides and side length.\n\n\n\n\nDebugging with \n\n\nYou can use pause all to place breaks in your code so you can see what’s happening along the way. When you run code with pause all in it, you can click the yellow Run/Pause button next to the Green Flag (/) to move through the code up until a pause all block is reached again. The pause all block will pause every script that is running until the yellow Run/Pause button is clicked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn page Lab 2 Page 4: Making Programs Talk, you learned about procedural abstraction: giving a code segment a name (making it a block). That way you can call it more than once instead of copying and pasting.\n\n\n\nAAP-3.B.4\n\n\nHere is another kind of abstraction: noticing that asterisk and polygon are both kinds of pinwheels, and writing one, more general, pinwheel block that uses an input so that the block can be used to make asterisks, polygons, or other interesting designs.\n\n\nAAP-3.B.5\n\n\nThis is an example of abstraction by generalization: looking at chunks of code that are almost the same and writing a single block by using an input to distinguish among the different cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you look inside of pinwheel and see how you’re using it in polygon, you’ll see that there are steps that you don’t really need for the case of a polygon. Write another version of polygon built directly out of primitive blocks (move, turn and so on). How simple can you make it?\n\n\n\nAAP-3.B.7\n\nAs long as your polygon block draws the right picture, it doesn’t matter to the rest of the project what’s inside it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse your pinwheel block code one last time to create a circle block that accepts one input for the size.\n\n\nUse the random block together with set pen color and set pen size to draw a variety of shapes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge: Create a script that draws a blue square of size 100 and then draws a red circle that fits perfectly inside it. \n\n\n\n\n                     \n\n\n\nThis Take it Further refers to what you did in Lab 6: Squiral. Take a look back at what you did for that lab and work with that code that you made for that lab to complete this.\n\n\n\nFind a way to use for to nest squares this way. Build your block with two inputs that let you specify how many squares the design will contain and how much bigger each square will be than the previous one.  \n\n\n\n\nOn the right is a painting by Josef Albers. He was interested in experimenting with variations of color within a “family” of similar colors. Snap! will let you make similar experiments.\n\n\n\nWhat is the favorite color of the author of this activity?\n\n\nIf you didn’t do the Take It Further activity based on this Kazimir Malevich picture  then read it now to learn about Snap! features for solid rectangles and color families.\n\n\nIf you haven’t already, do If There Is Time #10, which shows a simple version of this project idea.\n\n\nOkay, now dig in.\n\nRandomness: The four examples above are different from the actual Albers picture in that they include occasional colors that aren’t from the same family. This can make the pictures more interesting to someone who doesn’t share Albers’s interest in subtle differences in color. (Albers himself, in fact, had more color variation in other pictures of this type.) Too much randomness, though, can make the picture less interesting. Compare the last two examples above; the left one of those two is clearly based on the orange family, with rainbow-neighbors red and yellow, but the right one has violets, greens, oranges, a yellow—too much chaos, maybe. Look back at the Gossip project if you don’t remember how to choose something special once out of six times, or once out of 14 times. Other random choices you can make are the number of squares, how much to shrink the size from one square to the next, and how much to move the corner of the next square horizontally and vertically (the picture is more interesting if those two numbers are different, so the smallest square isn’t exactly in the center).\n\n\n\n   This block is like the squiral, but instead of changing the input to move, it changes the input to turn: \n\n\nTry sketching what it will draw with an angle of 2.\n\n\nThen build it, and try each of these tests:\n\nYou can stop each test with the stop button  when you’re sure nothing new will happen, but don’t decide that too quickly!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s going on? Can you work out a theory to predict anything about the shape it draws for a particular angle input? (Don’t click unless you need a big hint.)\n\nHint: Think about divisibility."

All kinds of data. In this example, the input is supposed to be a number, but any kind of value can be used as an input. For instance, you’ve seen the list block called with text as inputs. In Snap!, any kind of data can be used as an input, can be reported by a block, or can be put in a list.\n\n\n\n: What’s an input? Parameter vs. Argument\n\nAAP-3.A.3\n\n\n\n\nA parameter (or formal parameter) is the input name, such as number of branches. The input name is set in the block definition. It never changes. \n\n\nAn argument (or actual argument) is the input value, such as 6 for a hexagonal pinwheel. The input value is given each time the block is run; it can be a different value each time. \n\n\nWe use the word “input” both for parameters (input names) and for arguments (input values).\n\n\n\nAAP-3.B.4\n\n\nOriginally, you made five copies of the pinwheel script to create five slightly different pinwheels. Now, you’ve made a single procedure that includes the shared features of these five scripts and uses a parameter to handle the differences.\n\n\n\nCRD-2.G\n\n\n\n\nComment your code.\n\n\n\nDebugging Tip: Commenting Your Code\n\n\nCRD-2.G.2\n\n\nAdding comments to your code may help you remember what your code does, helps other people reading your code to understand it, and can help you avoid bugs by increasing the clarity of your program. But it won’t do any of those things if you comment every line of code, so each comment just says how a block inside your script works. You can add comments to your Snap! code by right-clicking (or control-clicking) in the Scripts area and choosing “add comment.” Click for an animation that shows how.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can attach a comment to the hat block in the Block Editor to create a help message for your block. This is the best way to comment, because people can find out what your block does without having to look inside, just like the help messages for primitive blocks.\n\n\n\nBad commenting:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood commenting:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPart of the reason some people emphasize the importance of detailed comments is that they are programming in text languages, which discourage long variable and procedure names. (Typically, you can’t include spaces in the names, and you have to type the entire name every time you use that variable or procedure.) So you see names like substLcUc instead of substitute lower case letters for capital letters in string. If a program is full of drastically abbreviated names for procedures and variables, it’s no surprise if the code needs documentation. In Snap!, the names in the program can be self-documenting.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore About Program Documentation\n\n\nCRD-2.G.1, CRD-2.G.5\n\n\nCommenting is only one form of documentation. It’s not the best form, because attaching a comment to a particular place in the program documents only that one procedure or code segment, and doesn’t explain how different sections of the program interact. But commenting is an easy way to document small details.\n\n\nDocumentation can be external (written for users of the program) or internal (written for yourself or other developers of the program). Both kinds are important, if it’s a program people other than the author are going to use. Usually they should be separate documents—another reason why comments aren’t the best form of documentation.\n\n\nCRD-2.G.4\n\n\nIf you’re writing a program by yourself, internal documentation may seem silly. “I know how my own program works.” But if the program will still be in use a year later, it will probably need maintenance, and you may well have forgotten the details of its implementation. In a programming class like this one, most of the programs you write are very small, and you can understand them at a glance. But real programs are generally much bigger than lab exercises designed to take less than an hour of work.\n\n\nCRD-2.G.3\n\n\nIt’s best if the first attempt at documentation is made even before starting to code. The documentation will specify the desired program behavior (external) and the intended program structure (internal). These documents can be used in testing the code to ensure that it behaves as planned.\n\n\n\n\nAAP-3.A part a\n\n\nCreate a script that draws two pinwheels on the stage, with different numbers of spokes.\n\n\n\n\nAAP-3.A.4\n\n\nWhen you embed a command procedure (such as pinwheel) within a script, the procedure is completed before continuing the script that called it.\n\n\n\n\nThese images were created with the pinwheel block and set pen color.

    "text": "On this page, you will learn about sprite turning angles, which are needed for drawing polygons. For starters, you’ll draw various asterisks, like these:    \n\n\n\nWhen you were trying to draw an equilateral triangle on the previous page, you might have tried code like this:  and seen a result like this:  It’s common to try this if you’ve learned that the angles in an equilateral triangle are all 60 degrees. However, the angle that the sprite needs to turn to make a triangle is actually 120 degrees, and it’s important to understand why that is and how to find the correct angle for other polygons (five-sided, eleven-sided, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform the four experiments (A-D), and read the comments attached to each one. As you do, talk with your partner about what you see and why it happens.\n\n\nThen, experiment with the last script (shown right): \n\n\nExperiment with a quarter turn (turn 90 degrees instead of 180). Adjust the number of repetitions (the number you give to repeat) until you get the sprite to finish facing the same way it started. \n\n\nExperiment with a tenth of a turn (turn 36 degrees). What input must you give to repeat to get the sprite to finish facing the same way it started?\n\n\nWithout trying it on the computer, figure out what turning angle to use for a five-spoke asterisk. Make sure your partner agrees.\n\n\nThen, try the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n Describe what you’ve learned about turning angles.\n\n\nAt the top of the page you were thinking about triangles. As a step in that direction, make a three-spoke asterisk.\n\nClick for a hint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 360° turn is a full turn. Half of that (180°) is a half turn. A fourth of 360°  is a quarter turn. You don’t have to do the division yourself. Snap! can compute it for you. You can use  or  to get a seventh of a turn or a third of a turn.\n\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of this page, you knew that to make a triangle you need 120° turns, but maybe you weren’t sure why. Now you know why a three-spoke asterisk takes 120° turns, but what does that have to do with triangles?\n\n\n\n\nTry different negative input values for the move -100 steps block (first -90, then -50, then -10), and do some of the turning experiments (above) with each value. Does this change the values needed for the repeat or turn blocks? These pictures are called “pinwheels.”\n\n\n\nNow, run script (A) in the file and experiment:\n\n\nChange the inputs in script A to draw an asterisk with:\n\n\n5 branches\n\n\n8 branches\n\n\n3 branches\n\n\n\n\nMake a copy of the three-branch script you built (right-click or control-click the script, and choose “duplicate”).\n\n\nIn the copy, remove the move -100 steps block.\n\n\nWhat does this new script do?\n\n\n\n\nMake another copy of the three-branch script you built, and then:\n\n\nChange it to a four-branch script.\n\n\nRemove the move -100 steps block again.\n\n\nWhat does this new script do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging with  \n\n\nYou can use say for to get information about the state of your program while it’s running.\n\n\nThis animation shows how to use say for to determine the bug in code that is supposed to draw a rectangle. Notice how say for makes the program pause and gives you information to help you identify the source of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript B in the same file shows how you can make a 60-branch script behave like the second hand of a clock. Try it out.\n\n\n\nBe sure you are able to explain how this script does what it does.\n\n\nWhy is the change in pen color and size useful here? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\nAt the right is a painting by Alma Thomas. See what it inspires you to do. It’s your art. Take liberties.\n\n\nGamal: It looks like a map. Houses on the left, the town center on the right, with City Hall and the fire station and the mall.\n\n\nBetsy: Maybe. To me the part on the left looks a little like a fingerprint, and the part on the right is clearly a person facing right, with her nose up against the right edge, halfway down.\n\n\nAlphie: Never mind what it looks like. How are we going to make something that looks like it?\n\n\nBetsy: Parts of it look like curved, thick dotted lines. We could do something like this:        But I’m not sure how to get a bunch of those to fit together.\n\n\nAlphie: Randomness is your friend. Let’s make a bunch of your lines, all different, and just point them in different directions.       \n\n\nBetsy: Wow! That’s very cool.\n\n\nAlphie: Nothing like what it’s supposed to look like, though.\n\n\nBetsy: What do you mean, “supposed”? Go read the boldface line up above this blue box again.\n\n\nAlphie: Yeah, I know, but “take liberties” doesn’t mean “take whatever happens on your first try.” I have another idea. We’ve been thinking of Thomas’s picture as brown boxes on a white background, but it’s actually more brown than white. What if we start with a brown background and draw white lines on it?\n\n\nGamal: What about that town center on the right?\n\n\nBetsy: It’s not a map. But to make you happy, when drawing white lines over toward the right, we can make them thicker, so the right part will have more white space than the left part.\n\n\nAlphie: Uh oh… If you look carefully at the original picture, the brown boxes aren’t all the same shade of brown.\n\n\nBetsy: Alphie, you worry too much. But to make you happy, once we have the space divided into brown regions, we can  some of them in different colors.\n\n\nGamal: Hey! Gang! Remember we imported that crayon library? Guess what! There’s a “World Map” library, too! And it makes “watercolor” maps like this:  And then I went over every dot on the stage using  and  to decide whether to make each dot white or brown: \n\n\n\n\nWhat did Alma Thomas intend by her painting: a map, a fingerprint, or something else?

Don’t let the paddle move beyond the edges of the stage.\n\n\nWrite the code to start the ball moving when green flag is clicked and to bounce off the stage edges and the paddle. Note that there is a built in block to bounce off the edges.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAdd scoring to your game. Every time the paddles bounces off the ball, the player should earn a point and every time the ball hits the right wall, the player should lose a point. You can create a variable to keep track of the score. \n\n\nCreate a second paddle to allow the game to become multiplayer game. Adjust your code to accommodate keyboard input from two users. \n\n\nCreate a second paddle (or use the one from part B if you did that) and let this paddle be driven automatically by the computer for a “human versus computer” version of the game.

Leave the Block Editor open.\n\n\n\n\nIn a number-guessing game, the player tries to guess the computer’s secret number. The computer needs a way to store the secret number in a variable so that it can compare it to the player’s guesses.\n\n\nA variable is like a labeled box that can hold one value at a time, such as one word, one costume, or one list (which can contain many things). You can look at what’s inside as many times as you want.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a variable called secret number to store the number that the player will try to guess (instructions below).\n\n\nMaking a Variable\n\n\n\nClick on make a variable in the Variables palette.\n\n\nName the variable secret number.\n\n\nLater, you can use the variable by dragging it out of where it appears at the top of the variables palatte (the way you drag an input) and placing it where you need it in your code.\n\n\n\n\nAAP-1.A, AAP-3.E\n\nUse  to set the initial value of secret number to a random number from 1 to 10. The set menu lets you select which variable to set. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn algebra, a variable is sometimes used for something whose value you don’t know yet, and the goal is to find out its value. In programming you decide the values of variables.\n\n\n\nWhen you assign a value to a variable, the variable holds that value, not where it came from. For example, if apples = 2 and you , then bananas will hold the value 2 and have no memory of it having come from apples. This is why\na ← a * 2\nmeans something. (Suppose a = 8. First compute the value of\na * 2\n, namely 16, and then replace the old value of a with 16). Up to now, the only variables you’ve used are input variables, and you never assign a value to an input because the value is given by the code that calls it. But a script variable won’t have a value until you give it one with set."

Drag one block underneath another to snap them together.\n\n\n \n\nCRD-2.B.1\n\n\nThis is a computer program, also known as software. It’s a very short one, but it’ll get more interesting soon.\n\n\n\nTest your program: Click on the Alonzo sprite on the stage several times. If your program works, Alonzo should move to a random position on the stage each time you click him.\n\n\nIf your program doesn’t work, look back at the picture of the code and make sure yours matches exactly.\n\n\nMake sure the two blocks are attached to each other by moving the when I am clicked block and checking that the go to block moves with it.\n\n\nMake sure that the first block says when I am (clicked) and not something else, and make sure that the second block says go to (random position) and not something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrange boxes contain the ideas you should still remember three years from now.\n\n  \n\nCRD-2.C.2, CRD-2.C.3, CRD-2.C.5\n\n\nBlocks that look like this can be used to detect an event such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button ().

Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap! programmers call them “hat blocks.” Using events to control a program is called event-driven programming.\n\n\nNot every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind when I am (clicked) and when (space) key pressed in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a good idea to save your project every so often.\n\n\n\n\nChoose “Save” from the Snap!

On this page, you will create a way for the player of your game to know how well they are doing.\n\n\nConfirming Whether Alonzo Was Clicked\n\n\nFirst, the person playing your game wants to know right away whether they succeeded at clicking Alonzo before he moved out of the way.\n\n\n: Sprites and Costumes\n\nThe Alonzo character is named after Alonzo Church, a major contributor to early computer science. In this project, there are three objects related to Alonzo:\n\n\nOne is a sprite, which is like an actor on the stage who knows how to do many different things, such as walk around the stage and speak the lines of the play.\n\n\nThe other two are costumes, picture that can be “worn” by a sprite.\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Alonzo to face the other way when clicked.   \n\n\nThe project you loaded has two Alonzo costumes—one facing right and the other facing left—so you can use the  block to make the sprite face the other way. Add the next costume block to the place in your program where the user has just clicked on Alonzo.\n\n\nTest your program. Make sure Alonzo faces the other way when he is clicked but not when he jumps without being clicked.\n\n\n\n\nKeeping Score\n\n\n\nThe player will also want to know how much progress they have made in the game. The command  can control Alonzo’s transparency.\n\n\n\nThe transparency of an image is how much you can see what’s behind it. For example, here is the Alonzo sprite shown with three different transparencies (which have been set using the ghost effect block). \n\n\n\n\nUse transparency to tell the user how close they are to winning: every time they click, Alonzo gets more invisible, and when he disappears completely, they win the game.\n\n\n\n\nDrag the change (ghost) effect block into the center scripting area, and experiment with different input numbers (clicking it repeatedly after each change) to see exactly what it does. At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become completely invisible? You can use the command  to make Alonzo fully opaque again.\n\n\nThen, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little more ghostly. Think about how the input you use affects the length of the game. Try out your game.\n\n\n\n\nMaking the Game More Challenging\n\n\nSo far, even a bad player will eventually make Alonzo disappear. The game will be much more interesting if the player is penalized for missing a click.\n\n\n\n\nFigure out where to add a change (ghost) effect by (-5) block to your script to make Alonzo get less transparent any time he moves without being clicked.\n\n\nPlay your game a few times, and adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.\n\n\nYou can change the change effect input number (for either instance of the block) and/or the wait time to make the game easier or harder.\n\n\n\n\nEnding the Game\n\n\n\nWhen Alonzo is completely transparent, the game should stop.\n\n\n\nAdd this code to the right place in your script to end the game."

    "text": "On this page, you will learn about collaborating by using pair programming.\n\n\n\nIn the early days of computers, programming was something you did alone. You planned the program in your head, and then you sat down and wrote the code.\n\n\nThe programs people write these days are far too complicated for that. Graphical user interfaces, interacting with servers on the Internet, internationalization, security against malware attacks, and many more requirements are part of a serious software development effort, and a program is likely to have hundreds of authors.\n\n\nThis means that collaboration skills are as important as coding skills today. Even if you don’t end up working as a programmer, collaboration is part of most jobs.\n\n\nCRD-1.B.2\n\nWe’ll watch this video in class together, but here it is in case you want to watch it again:\n\n\nThere are several ways to organize a collaboration. In this course, you’ll use a collaboration technique called pair programming—writing computer programs in teams of two. One partner, the driver, controls the computer. The other, the navigator, helps catch errors and keeps track of how the code being written fits into the overall plan. The navigator is also in charge of reading the lab pages out loud. Aim for equal time in each role, switching about every five minutes.\n\n\n\nHow not to do pair programming:\n\n\nThe biggest mistake in pair programming is for the navigator to tune out and let the driver do all the work. The navigator has to be paying attention; otherwise you’re just taking turns doing the entire work instead of making use of the benefits of having two people.\n\n\n\nHow to collaborate in pair programming\n\n\nCRD-1.C.1:\n\n\ncommunication - Keep talking, Listen\n\n\nconsensus building - Don’t bargain\n\n\nconflict resolution - Don’t get defensive, Don’t be afraid of conflict\n\n\nnegotiation - Don’t bargain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep talking. The driver should constantly explain the reason for using each block. The navigator should interrupt with questions: What about doing it this other way? How does this program avoid such-and-such bug? Don’t we have to deal with this requirement and that requirement at the same time? We’re pretty much repeating this other piece of code over there; could we hide that code in a block and use the same block in both places? And so on.\n\n\nListen. Try to understand each other’s thinking before you disagree.\n\n\nWork as a team. If you find yourself being defensive about feedback, remember that nobody’s code is perfect right away. It’s the navigator’s job to find problems in the driver’s code, and when you switch places, the new navigator will repay the favor. You’re a team, not a competition.\n\n\nWork toward consensus. Don’t bargain; if you have disagreements about how something should be done, don’t say “well, you can do this your way if I can have this other thing my way.” Both partners should listen to each other’s reasons and work together to find a solution that meets both needs.\n\n\nSpeak your mind and work out your differences. That doesn’t mean you should try to disagree, but if you do, you can still be friends. Work out the conflict by listening and understanding each other, rather than by giving in just to end the argument.\n\n\nRegardless of experience, take turns. Don’t let the more experienced programmer overwhelm the other partner. Make sure both partners are comfortable contributing, in either role. A group is almost always better at problem-solving than any of the people in the group is alone.\n\n\n\n\nIn the first unit, we’ll use these symbols to remind you to switch roles at specific points in the lab. After this unit, you’re on your own to be sure to switch about every five minutes.  \n\n\n\nAt this point in class, we’ll be playing a game called “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes”\n\n\nSit down with your partner at one computer to learn how to play the game.\n\n\nFor convenience, here’s the link to the bomb defusal manual,."

    "text": "On this page, you will use a global variable to keep score in your Click Alonzo game.\n\n\n\nIn your Number Guessing Game, you used script variables to store information (the value of secret number) that was needed by only one script. To keep score in Click Alonzo, more than one script will need access to that information, so you’ll use a global variable.\n\n\n: Global Variable\n\nA global variable is a variable that is usable by all scripts in the program.\n\n\n\n\nWhen are global variables needed?\n\n\nMost of the time, script variables are a better choice because they can’t be changed by some other part of the program, and so they reduce the chance of bugs. But if multiple scripts need access to a variable or if the information in that variable needs to be saved with your project, then use a global variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen your L1-ClickAlonzo project, play the game, and review the code so you remember how it works.\n\n\nCreate a global variable named score. Here’s how.\n\n\n\nMaking a Global Variable\n\n\n\nClick  in the Variables palette. (It’s not a block; you can’t drag it into the scripting area.)\n\n\nType the title for your variable. In this case, it’s score.\n\n\nClick “OK.”\n\n\n\n\nUse the score variable to keep track of the player’s score:\n\n\nInitialize score to 0 at the beginning of the game.\n\n\n\nSetting the starting value of a variable is known as initializing the variable.\n\n\n\nAAP-1.B.1\n\n\nMake the program change the score by 1 whenever the sprite is clicked.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest and debug. Play the game enough to make sure that the score variable works. \n\n\n Right now, the game doesn’t have a way to win, but you’ll change that. Decide on the score that you will use to test whether the player has won.\n\n\nUse a conditional to determine when the player reaches that score. When they do:\n\n\nMake Alonzo stop jumping around.\n\n\nMake Alonzo appear again. (You’ll have to reset the ghost effect.)\n\n\nCongratulate the player for a few seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest and debug. Take turns playing, and fix any bugs. \n\n\nDebugging Tip: Display of Variables\n\n\nWhen you are debugging your code, it can help to see the value of a variable at different points in your program. This is done differently for local and global variables:\n\n\nGlobal variables have check-boxes that control the display of the variable watcher on the stage (shown below). \n\n\nIf it’s a local (script) variable, you can use the show variable block inside the script to display a watcher on the stage (and use hide variable to hide it again).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the sprite moves without being clicked, make the score go down by 1.\n\n\nGame too hard? Increase the score by 2 for a hit. Too big a change? Increase by 3 for a hit, decrease by 2 for a miss. You can make arbitrarily fine adjustments. This process is called playtuning a game."
