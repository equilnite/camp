<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will use <em>variables</em> to store information.</p>

<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will begin to develop a number guessing game that uses a <em>variable</em> to keep track of a secret number.</p>

<li>Start building a new command block (the kind shaped like a puzzle piece) called <code>number guessing game</code> that will contain the code for the game. Leave the Block Editor open.</li>

</ol>
:::

<p>In a number-guessing game, the player tries to guess the computer's secret number. The computer needs a way to store the secret number in a <em>variable</em> so that it can compare it to the player's guesses.<br /></p>
: <strong>Variable</strong>

<p>A <strong>variable</strong> is like a labeled box that can hold one value at a time, such as one word, one costume, or one list (which can contain many things). You can look at what's inside as many times as you want.</p>

<li>

Create a variable called <var>secret number</var> to store the number that the player will try to guess (instructions below).

<h3><strong>Making a Variable</strong></h3>

<ol type="a">

<li>Click on <strong>make a variable</strong> in the Variables palette.<br /> </li>

<li>Name the variable <var>secret number</var>.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Later, you can use the variable</strong> by dragging it out of where it appears at the top of the <code>variables</code> palatte (the way you drag an input) and placing it where you need it in your code.

Use <img src="/img/blocks/set-empty.png" title="set () to ()" alt="set () to ()" class="inline nopadtb"/> to set the initial value of <var>secret number</var> to a random number from 1 to 10. The <code>set</code> menu lets you select which variable to set. <br />

<p>In algebra, a variable is sometimes used for something whose value you don't know yet, and the goal is to find out its value. In programming <em>you decide</em> the values of variables.</p>
:::

::: pseudop
When you assign a value to a variable, the variable holds that value, not where it came from. For example, if <var>apples</var> = 2 and you <img src="/img/2-complexity/set-bananas-to-apples.png" title="set (bananas) to (apples)" alt="set (bananas) to (apples)"/>, then <var>bananas</var> will hold the value 2 and have no memory of it having come from <var>apples</var>. This is why

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">a &larr; a * 2</pre>
```
means something. (Suppose <var>a</var> = 8. First compute the value of

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">a * 2</pre>
```
, namely 16, and then replace the old value of <var>a</var> with 16). Up to now, the only variables you've used are input variables, and you never assign a value to an input because the value is given by the code that calls it. But a script variable won't have a value until you give it one with <code>set</code>.
