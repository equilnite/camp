<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you'll continue to develop your number guessing game to accept player guesses until the player guesses correctly.</p>
:::

<!--<div class="index-term" id="<code>repeat until</code> block" />-->

<p>You'll want the computer to ask players to guess again and again until they guess correctly. To do that, you will use the <img src="/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" title="repeat until" alt="repeat until" class="inline nopadtb"/> block. <code>Repeat until</code> is a <em>loop</em> (just like <code>forever</code>) but also a <em>conditional</em> (like <code>if</code> and <code>if else</code>). It repeats until a certain condition is met. For this program, the code should repeat until the player's answer equals the secret number.</p>

<p><code>Repeat until</code> makes its decision based on the output of a hexagonal <em>predicate</em> block.</p>

<a href="#hint-Boolean" data-bs-toggle="collapse" title="Why is Boolean capitalized?"> <img src="/img/icons/read-more-mini.png" title="Read More" alt="Read More" class="inline"/> Why is Boolean capitalized? </a>

::: {#hint-Boolean .collapse}
<p>The word Boolean is capitalized because it's named after a person, George Boole, who invented the branch of mathematics dealing with Boolean operations (such as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>).</p>
:::
:::

<p>A <strong>predicate</strong> is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question such as these examples:<br /> <img class="indent" src="/img/2-complexity/8-gt-7-reporting-true.png" alt="8 > 7 reporting true" title="8 > 7 reporting true"><img class="indent" src="/img/2-complexity/6-gt-7-reporting-false.png" alt="6 > 7 reporting false" title="6 > 7 reporting false"></p>

<p>Predicates report a <strong>Boolean value</strong> (either <img src="/img/blocks/true.png" title="true" alt="true" class="inline"/> or <img src="/img/blocks/false.png" title="false" alt="false" class="inline"/>).</p>
:::

<p>Predicates fit into a hexagonal input slots of conditionals, such as in <img src="/img/blocks/if-full-size.png" title="if block" alt="if block" class="inline"/> and <img src="/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" title="repeat until" alt="repeat until" class="inline"/>. Predicates help conditionals <em>decide when to do something</em>.</p>

::: vocabFullWidth
<p>The <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code> blocks are called <strong>conditionals</strong> because they control the code based on a true-or-false <strong>condition</strong>.</p>
