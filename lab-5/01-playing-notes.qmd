In this activity, you'll teach the computer to play some simple songs and move those songs up and down the musical scale.

<p>A <strong>command</strong> block tells the computer to do something <em>without reporting a value</em>.</p>
:::

<li>Open this <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/prog/lab-5/song-player.xml" title="Song Player - Snap! project" target="_blank">Song Player</a> project, and save it to your account. It includes a <img src="/img/U2/lab01/play-emoji-note.png" title="play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()" alt="play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()" class="inline nopadtb"/> <em>command</em> block that takes two inputs: a note to play (<var>pitch</var>) and how long to play it (<var>beats</var>).</li>

::: {.endnote style="clear: right;"}

<p>The <var>pitch</var> tells the computer which note to play. It can be any whole number from 0 to 127. The number 60 represents the note known as <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_C" title="middle C" target="_blank">middle C</a>. If you click the triangle (▼), a piano menu will open, and you can hear the note you are selecting.<br /> <img src="/img/U2/lab01/play-emoji-note-piano-menu.png" title="image of &apos;play note (60) for (0.5) beats&apos; block with piano menu open for first input slot and middle C selected and labeled &apos;C(60)&apos;" alt="image of &apos;play note (60) for (0.5) beats&apos; block with piano menu open for first input slot and middle C selected and labeled &apos;C(60)&apos;" class="indent"/></p>

<p>The number of <var>beats</var> tells the computer how long to play the note. By default, Snap<em>!</em> plays 60 beats per minute (bpm), so playing a note for 1 beat takes 1 second. You can change the number of beats per minute by using <img src="/img/blocks/set-tempo.png" title="set tempo to () bpm" alt="set tempo to () bpm" class="inline nopadtb"/>.</p>
:::

<li>Change the inputs to the <code>play ♪</code> block and then click it, and then change the inputs and click it again to see how the note changes.</li>

::: sidenote
<strong>Tip:</strong> Right click a block and select "help" to see an explanation of how to use it.
:::

<li>

Attach several <code>play ♪</code> blocks together one after another to begin creating a song.

<ul>

<li>You can use <img src="/img/blocks/rest.png" title="rest for () beats" alt="rest for () beats" class="inline nopadtb"/> to create breaks in your song.</li>

<li>You can use <img src="/img/blocks/repeat.png" title="repeat () {}" alt="repeat () {}" class="inline nopadtb"/> block to repeat any command (or group of commands) a specific number of times. Any code you put inside the C-shape of the <code>repeat</code> block will be repeated.</li>

<li>You can also use <img src="/img/blocks/set-instrument-to.png" title="set instrument to (1)" alt="set instrument to (1)" class="inline nopadtb"/> to change the instrument, <img src="/img/blocks/set-tempo.png" title="set tempo to () bpm" alt="set tempo to () bpm" class="inline nopadtb"/> to change the tempo (beats per minute), or <img src="/img/blocks/set-volume-to-100.png" title="set volume to () %" alt="set volume to () %" class="inline nopadtb"/> to change the volume. Wherever you put one of these blocks, the sound will change from that point on.</li>

</ul>
