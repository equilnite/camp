### Using <code>For Each</code> to Traverse a List

::: todo
<p>The paragraph below is well-intentioned, but it doesn't belong here. Maybe after your sample song that uses REPEAT?</p>

<p>Where do you mean, exactly? --MF, 3/6/22</p>

::: todo
<p>Using the <code>repeat</code> block strategically can make your code shorter and easier to read. It's generally a good idea to write shorter code that is easier to read because when something isn't working right, it's easier to find and fix the problem, or when you want to change it later or have someone else read it, that's easier too.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blocks/for-each.png" title="for each (item) in &apos;list input slot&apos; {
}" alt="for each (item) in &apos;list input slot&apos; {
}" class="imageRight nopadtb"/> One way to simplify writing a song is to use a <em>list</em> to store the pitches and then play each pitch in the list. You can use <code>for each</code> to run a command (or group of commands) for each item in a list. For example: <br /> <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/prog/lab-5/sample-song-with-for-each.xml" title="Example of For Each - Snap! project" target="_blank"><img src="/img/U2/lab01/example-for-each.png" title="for each (pitch) in (list (60) (60) (67) (67) (69) (69) (67) (0) (65) (65) (64) (64) (62) (62) (60) (0)) {
play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
}" alt="for each (pitch) in (list (60) (60) (67) (67) (69) (69) (67) (0) (65) (65) (64) (64) (62) (62) (60) (0)) {
play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
}" class="indent"/></a></p>

Playing the pitch 0 works like a rest (a pause in the music).

<p>A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered sequence of items. You've been using lists throughout this course: to store words for a story, to manipulate the letters of a secret message, and even to store lists such as each individual's responses to the question in a survey.</p>

::: {#ordered .collapse}
<p>It doesn't mean that the items have to appear in alphabetical or numeric order. It just means that these are different lists:<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/list-a-b.png" title="(list a b" alt="(list a b)" class="indent"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/list-b-a.png" title="(list b a)" alt="(list b a)" class="indent"/></p>

<p>This might be a risky move. I was hoping to give the kids a chance to start from scratch if they had a cluttered project, but it does mean that from this page on, some students will have only one project for the lab while others will have two. It also means that I can't refer to their project by name on the subsequent pages, so if they name it awkwardly and forget the name, they won't be able to find it. Thoughts? --MF, 2/23/22</p>

<p>The further along I get in writing this lab, the more I regret this choice because I have no way of telling them what project I want them to open other than "your last one". I'm now thinking they should start from a new starter XML here without any option. Thoughts? --MF, 2/27/22</p>

<p>I agree, pick one. I first thought they should start with the example project, but then they don't get the practice in exercise 2. Maybe have them start with the sample (which should be called the <em>starter</em> instead of sample) but still make them make their own FOR EACH block? -bh 3/3/22</p>

<p>How about they start with starter project and you can remind them they can open up song player in another tab to remember the pitches that they used? -pf 3/3/22</p>

<p>To resolve next time around. --MF, 3/6/22</p>

<li>Open the <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/prog/lab-5/sample-song-with-for-each.xml" title="Example of For Each - Snap! project" target="_blank"><code>for each</code> example project</a> and save it to your Snap<em>!</em> account.</li>

<li>Open your "Song Player" project if isn't open already.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

Create a simple song using <code>for each</code>. If you opened the example project, edit the pitches in the list to create your song. If you opened your own "Song Player" project...

<ol>

<li>Drag a <code>for each</code> block into the scripting area, and drag a <code>play ♪</code> block inside it.<br /> <img src="/img/U2/lab01/for-each-play-note.png" title="for each (item) in &apos;list input slot {

Rename the <var>item</var> variable to <var>pitch</var> by clicking it, typing the new name ("pitch"), and clicking "OK."<br />

<p>The orange color of item is inaccessible per https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ It would need to be a significantly darker orange to meet a11y contrast standards. -pf 3/3/22</p>

Tips for working with the <code>list</code> block:

<ul>

<li>If you hold down the "shift" key when you press the ◂ or ▸ buttons, it will remove or add <em>three</em> spaces at the end of the list instead of just one.</li>

<li>You can press the "tab" key to move the typing cursor to the next input slot without using your mouse.</li>

<li>If you want to add or remove a pitch from your list, you don't have to move the other numbers around. To add a new slot, right-click the slot where you want it to appear, and select "insert a slot." To remove a slot, right-click it, and select "delete slot."</li>

</ul>

<li>Make sure your script plays your song correctly before moving on.</li>

<p>How much experience have they had before this of generalizing a script by turning it into a procedure with an input? They should have done that several times by now, no? So that experience should be called out here. "Remember how you generalized your blah blah by making it a procedure with an input? You can do the same thing with this script that plays the notes in a list." --bh 3/3/22</p>

<li>Create a new block called <code>play song</code> that takes one input called <var>song</var>, which will be a list of pitches. (To add an input, you have the hover over the tiny space to the right of the block name to get the plus sign (+) to show up and then click it.)</li>

<p>Sorry, this is another Snap bug report, but when I ran play-song, the song suddenly sounded horrifying. I even added an explicit set-instrument to 1 but it still sounds really sharp/grating. It did that for the first 3 times I played it. After writing this comment, it seems to be okay. Not sure what triggers it. I still am getting the issue where switching tabs while playing a song prolongs the current note, that seems very repeatable. -pf 3/3/22</p>

<p>This needs to go on GH not in the curriculum. https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap/issues :) --MF, 3/6/22</p>

<li>Try out your <code>play song</code> block with at least two different lists of pitches, and fix any issues with the block.</li>

<li>

Create help text for your <code>play song</code> block by attaching a comment to the hat block. The help text should describe what the block takes as input and what effect the block produces.

In this activity, you used <code>for each</code> to play each pitch in a list and created a <code>play song</code> block that will work with any list of pitches.

The next pages are extra content with concepts that you do not have to learn, but if you're done with these first 5 pages (pages 1 to 5), we encourage you to work on the next 4 pages of this lab. Ask any questions that you may have!

Otherwise, the expectation is that you continue off of pages 1-5 and work making your current code more creative. Explore making other tunes/songs, putting a spin on what you already have, etc.
