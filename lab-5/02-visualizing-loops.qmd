In this activity, you will experiment with <em>loops</em> and see how they control the order in which the commands are run.

<h3>Using Visible Stepping</h3>

<p>Snap<em>!</em> has a tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to watch Snap<em>!</em> process the blocks of your code in order.</p>

::: forYouToDo
<ol>

<li>

<img src="/img/icons/headphones.png" title="Set Up Your Headphones or Speakers" alt="Set Up Your Headphones or Speakers" class="imageRight"/> Open this <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/prog/lab-5/sample-song-player-fur-elise.xml" title="Sample Song Player - Snap! project" target="_blank">Für Elise Example Song</a>, click the Visible Stepping button (<img src="/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" class="inline nopadtb"/>), click the script to play the song, and watch how Visible Stepping shows how the program moves through the nested repeat blocks.<br />

<p>It feels like Snap speeds up the playback in each subsequent repeat, maybe due to having the audio cached? I felt like it was getting faster and faster. Not sure if thats in my head or not! Also, another Snap music bug- it seems like the final note sometimes persists for way longer, perhaps related to me being in a separate tab. -PF 3/3/22</p>

<p>Yes, that's by design. ;) There is a <code>change tempo</code> block inside the repeat. I was hoping that students would discuss this script and realize what is happening. I do generally experience weird sound stuff, but not a long last note; I get shortened first notes! I believe Michael thinks that has to do with the way sounds are implemented. --MF, 3/6/22</p>

<li><img src="/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner" alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="imageRight"/> Discuss what happens when the script is run. In what order does Snap<em>!</em> run these instructions? Why does the song get faster?</li>

<li>Now, open your "Song Player" project from the previous activity page, click the Visible Stepping button, and play your song.</li>

What's the point of this box? Does it say anything that isn't obvious? That the kids don't already know? --bh 3/3/22

Visible Stepping (<img src="/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" class="inline nopadtb"/>) can be useful when reading code because you can see what block is running.

<h3>Looping Your Song</h3>

::: forYouToDo
<ol start="4">

::: vocab
<p>Repeating the same set of commands (such as with <code>repeat</code> or <code>forever</code>) is called <strong>looping</strong> or <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>
:::

<li>If you haven't already, try using the <img src="/img/blocks/repeat.png" title="repeat () {}" alt="repeat () {}" class="inline nopadtb"/> block to repeat a note or a sequence of notes in a song. Play your song with Visible Stepping turned on.</li>

<li>Try nesting one <code>repeat</code> inside another as in the "Für Elise" example above.</li>

<li>

Try using a <img src="/img/blocks/forever-full-size.png" title="forever" alt="forever" class="inline nopadtb"/> block to repeat a command (or group of commands) forever, and play your song with Visible Stepping on.

::: {.narrower style="clear: right;"}
The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you stop it. You can <strong>click the red stop sign</strong> (<img src="/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" title="red stop button" alt="red stop button"/>) to stop all scripts in your project from running, or you can click an individual script to stop it.

In this activity, you used <em>iteration</em> to repeat a set of commands.

::: todo
What? You used iteration <em>by repeating</em> a set of commands, if anything. Does this box really mean "In this activity you learned the word 'iteration'"? (And, Mary, aren't you the comma minimalist in our gang?) --bh 3/3/22

<p>I'm not sure what the issue is here, Brian. Could you please suggest an alternative? --MF, 3/6/22</p>
