The block <img src="/img/1-introduction/more-complicated-who.png" title="more complicated who" alt="more complicated who"/> has been built for you. It randomly chooses 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if that number is 3, then it reports something more complicated than <code>who</code>. Otherwise, it reports <code>who</code>, just as before.

::: {#first .forYouToDo}
<ol>

<li>If it isn't open already, open your L2-Gossip project.</li>

<li>Find <img src="/img/1-introduction/more-complicated-who.png" title="more complicated who" alt="more complicated who"/> in the red Lists palette, drag it into the scripting area, and click on it enough times to see how it's different from <code>who</code>.</li>

<li>

<!--<div class="index-term" id="pick random</code>"></div>-->

Here is the code for <code>more complicated who</code>. There are two new things in it: <code>pick random</code> and <code>if else</code>.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/more-complicated-who-script.png" title="more complicated who {
if (pick random (1) to (4)) = (3) {
report (join (who) (&apos;, who&apos;) (does what) ( ) (who) (,))                                                                                          
} else {
report (who)
}
}" alt="more complicated who {
if (pick random (1) to (4)) = (3) {
report (join (who) (&apos; who&apos;) (does what) ( ) (who))                                                                                          
} else {
report (who)
}
}" class="indent"/>

<ol>

<li>Find <img src="/img/blocks/pick-random-1-to-10-full-size.png" title="pick random (1) to (10)" alt="pick random (1) to (10)" class="inline"/> in the green Operators palette, and click it several times. What does the <code>random</code> block do?</li>

<li><img src="/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner" alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline"/> In the <code>more complicated who</code> block, what happens if the <code>pick random</code> block picks 3? What if it picks 4?</li>

: <strong>Expressions</strong> and <strong>Values</strong>

::: comment
AAP-2.B.3, AAP-2.B.4
:::

<ul>

<li>An <strong>expression</strong> is a either a constant value (such as "4" or "winter") or a call to a reporter block including its inputs (such as <img src="/img/2-complexity/number.png" title="number" alt="number" class="inline"/>, <img src="/img/1-introduction/5+(4x3).png" title="5 + (4 * 3)" alt="5 + (4 * 3)" class="inline nopadtb"/>, or <img src="/img/2-complexity/join-who-doeswhat-who.png" title="join (who) ( ) (does what) ( ) (who)" alt="join (who) ( ) (does what) ( ) (who)" class="inline"/>).</li>

<li>Expressions are evaluated to produce a <em>single</em> <strong>value</strong> (a value can be a number, a string, a sprite, a costume, a script, a list---anything). For example, <img src="/img/1-introduction/5+(4x3).png" title="5 + (4 * 3)" alt="5 + (4 * 3)" class="inline nopadtb"/> will be evaluated to 17.</li>

</ul>

::: forYouToDo
<ol start="4">

<li>Create a new block <img src="/img/1-introduction/complicated-gossip.png" title="complicated gossip" alt="complicated gossip" class="inline nopadtb"/> that is similar to <code>gossip</code> but that uses <code>more complicated who</code> instead of <code>who</code>. (You can choose which <code>who</code> to replace, or you could replace both.)</li>

<li>Change the script for Sprite to use <code>complicated gossip</code> instead of <code>gossip</code>. Run your code, and fix any problems.</li>

## Making a Block Call Itself

::: forYouToDo
<ol start="8">

<li>Edit <code>more complicated who</code>. Replace <em>one</em> of the <code>who</code> blocks with a fresh copy of <code>more complicated who</code> that you drag in from the palette. Click <code>more complicated who</code> enough times to see how it has changed.</li>

::: ifTime
<ol start="10">

<li>Make Sprite(2) occasionally give a more complicated reply.</li>

::: takeItFurther
<ol type="A">

<li>Make <code>more complicated who</code> give the more complicated response three out of four times instead of one out of four times.</li>

<li>What happens when you try it out? Was it what you expected? Explain why it happened.</li>
