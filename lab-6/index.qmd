<strong>On this lab,</strong> you will use <code>for</code> loops not only to repeat, but also to count the repetitions and then use that counter to draw shapes with repeated patterns:<br /> <img src="/img/prog/spiral.png" title="spiral" alt="spiral" class="indent"/>

<p>

You've seen these ways to repeat a set of commands:

<ul>

::: sidenoteBig
The <code>forever</code> block generates an <em>infinite loop</em> that goes on forever. An infinite loop can sometimes be the result of a bug, but in some interactive programs, you <em>want</em> the program to keep running until stopped by the user.
:::

<li><img src="/img/blocks/forever.png" title="the forever block" alt="the forever block" class="inline"/> repeats the same commands <em>forever</em>. (You used it to make Alonzo keep moving in <a href="/lab-1/2-start-your-first-snap-app.html" title="Lab 1 Page 2: Programming a Game">Lab 1 Page 2: Programming a Game</a>.)</li>

<li><img src="/img/1-introduction/repeat.png" title="the repeat block" alt="the repeat block" class="inline"/> repeats them <em>a specific number of times</em>.</li>

<!--<li><img src="/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" alt="repeat until" title="repeat until" /> repeats until <em>some special condition</em> occurs.</li>-->

</ul>

</p>

<p>Sometimes the script inside a loop needs to know which time through the loop it's in (first, second, etc.). You can use <img src="/img/prog/for.png" title="for(i)=(1) to (10){}" alt="for(i)=(1) to (10){}" class="imageCenter"/> to keep track, and you can use its counter (the default name is <img src="/img/blocks/variable-i.png" title="i" alt="i" class="inline"/>) in the repeated script. For example, the <code>for</code> block lets you simplify long scripts like: <br /> <img src="/img/looping/for-loop-equivalent.png" title="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" alt="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" class="indent"/>\
      to\
<img src="/img/looping/for-loop-drag-i.gif" title="for (i)= (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" alt="for (i)= (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" class="noshadow"/></p>

<p>Each time the <code>for</code> block runs the script inside, it changes the value of the counter by 1, beginning with the first input number and ending after the second.</p>

::: takeNote
The <code>for</code> block's default counter name, <img src="/img/blocks/variable-i.png" title="i" alt="i" class="inline"/> stands for "index." You can change this name by <strong>clicking it</strong>. To use the counter, drag it into the script.

<li>

Build this script that makes the sprite say the numbers 1 through 10. <br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/for-i-1-10-say-i.png" title="for (i) = (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" alt="for (i) = (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" class="indent"/>

<ol>

<li>Then modify it so that the sprite says 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... up through 30.</li>

<li>Discuss your solutions with another pair.</li>

<li>

Experiment with spirals.

Build this script and try it out:<br />

<li><img src="/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner" alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline"/> Make sure you can explain why the squiral spirals outward.</li>

<li>Try switching the order of the 100 and the 1 in the <code>for</code> block in the squiral script. What is the result?</li>

<li>Try changing the turning angle in the squiral script to other numbers such as 92, 126, etc.</li>

<li>Change the inputs to <code>turn</code> and <code>move</code> to get as close as you can get to a smooth spiral:<br /> <img src="/img/prog/spiral.png" title="spiral" alt="spiral" class="indent"/></li>
