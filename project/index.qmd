<strong>In this project,</strong> you will apply your current knowledge of computer science towards creating an <em>eCard</em> of your choice following the guidelines listed on this page.

On the last day of this week, we will have a gallery walk to show everyone the progress that you've made!

## eCard Guidelines

Create an eCard ([see what an eCard is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-card)) that meets all of the following specifications:

(@) Uses ![the green flag](/img/sys/button-green-flag.png) or has a button in the card to start the eCard.
(@) Has a message for the viewer (such as "Happy New Year," "Happy Birthday," "Get Well Soon," etc.)
(@) Has a theme (such as holiday, sports, TV show, a photo, original art, etc.)
(@) Has stage and sprite costumes
(@) Makes use of as many of these 5 big ideas as possible:
    1. Algorithms
    2. Variables
    3. Conditionals
    4. Iteration
    5. Abstraction
(@) Lets the user interact (e.g., by clicking a sprite, pressing a key, or moving the mouse)
(@) Don't forget, you can use the following to make your eCard better!
    - Sounds or music (using the `play` block and/or the "Sounds" tab) 
    - The `random` block
